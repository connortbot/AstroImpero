# Astro Impero v0.9.5 (unprepped)

*Please note that the current main branch is a port of a privately developed version that has not been fully tested. The previous testing team is indefinitely inactive and I am currently primarily focusing on the Caitlyn renderer under Cypraeno. Feel free to look through the code!*.

**Astro Impero** is a turn-based space strategy taking place in the fictional war-filled Adano Galaxy. Dive into the middle of one of the biggest wars in history and bring glory to your empire.

Astro Impero prides itself on easy-to-learn mechanics that add strategic depth. Our supply and movement system is simple, but combined with production, resources, and different kinds of troops, space combat leaves much to replay.
